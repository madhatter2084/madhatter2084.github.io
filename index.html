        Currently, I run the GameStop at the Garden State Plaza. 
        I've been with GameStop off and on for almost 10 years. 
        As a Store Leader Mentor, I've learned the necessary leadership 
        skills to not only keep a high volume store running smoothly, 
        but also to effectively staff and train new stores.
        Before my years in retail, I spent some time in the United States Marine Corps. 
        During my tenure, I learned many skills that pushed me to enjoy technology. 
        Ultimately, that's what started me on the path to wanting to learn more 
        about web development.
